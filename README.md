# Game-of-Life
This project recreates Conwayâ€™s Game of Life using StdDraw for the graphics. The program initializes a grid of cells with randomly placed patterns, including gliders, blinkers, and ten-cell rows. It then continuously updates the grid according to the Game of Life rules, displaying the patterns evolving over time. The program takes two command-line arguments: grid size and number of patterns.

Below, the command line arguments are: 100 5
